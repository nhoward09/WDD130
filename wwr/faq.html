                    <li><span class="bullet-heads">Swimsuit or Quick-Drying Clothing:</span> You'll want to wear a swimsuit or moisture-wicking, quick-drying clothing. Avoid wearing cotton as it retains moisture and can make you feel cold and uncomfortable.</li>
                
                    <li><span class="bullet-heads">Water Shoes or Secure Footwear:</span> Wear shoes that can get wet and have good traction. Water shoes or river sandals with straps are ideal. Make sure they fit securely and won't come off easily.</li>
                
                    <li><span class="bullet-heads">Sun Protection:</span> Use sunscreen to protect your skin from the sun's UV rays. You can also wear a wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses with a strap to shield your eyes.</li>
                
                    <li><span class="bullet-heads">Wetsuit:</span> In colder weather or if the water temperature is low, the rafting company may provide wetsuits. If not, you can consider wearing a wetsuit for added warmth.</li>
                
                    <li><span class="bullet-heads">Splash Jacket or Wet Top:</span> If you're rafting in cooler conditions or during colder seasons, you may want to wear a splash jacket or wet top to keep you dry and warm.</li>
                
                    <li><span class="bullet-heads">Personal Floatation Device (PFD):</span> You'll be provided with a PFD by the rafting company, and it's essential to wear it at all times. Ensure that it fits properly and is securely fastened.</li>
                
                    <li><span class="bullet-heads">Helmet:</span> A helmet is also provided by the rafting company for safety. Make sure it's properly fitted and secure on your head.</li>
                
                    <li><span class="bullet-heads">Additional Layers:</span> Depending on the weather, you may want to bring additional layers like a thermal shirt or rash guard for added warmth and protection.</li>
                
                    <li><span class="bullet-heads">Change of Clothes:</span> After the rafting trip, it's a good idea to have a change of dry clothes for post-rafting comfort.</li>
                
                    <li><span class="bullet-heads">Secure Straps and Eyeglass Retainers:</span> If you wear eyeglasses or sunglasses, use straps or retainers to ensure they don't get lost in the water.</li>
