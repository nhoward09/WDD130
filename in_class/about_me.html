    <h2>What is the point in learning about Web design?</h2>
    <p>Well for me, if/when I decide to create my own buisness, knowing how to make and design a webpage to fit the requirments needed will be a huge benifit.</p>

    <h2>What is Nick's favorite scripture?</h2>
    <p>I have always loved the war chapters in the Book of Mormon! I can't say that I have a favorite scripture, but my favorite story is probably the story of Amalakiah! I love how the Nephites were able to fend off his advances and it always brings a new strategy of how I can handle life each time that I read it.</p>
